## ‚ú® Purpose

This framework is part of an interdisciplinary vision to combine **symbolic rigor**, **neural adaptability**, and **cognitive-aligned reasoning**. It reflects years of integrated work at the intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology.

It is not just software. It is a **cognitive architecture**, and its use is **ethically bounded**.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pixi package manager (recommended)
- Mojo Programming Language (will be installed via setup script)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cognitive-design-framework.git
cd cognitive-design-framework

# Install Python dependencies via Pixi
pixi install

# Install Mojo (one-time setup)
./scripts/setup_mojo.sh

# Activate the environment
pixi shell

# Verify installation
mojo --version
```

### Alternative Installation (Python only)
```bash
# Using Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Still need to install Mojo separately
./scripts/setup_mojo.sh
```

### Basic Usage
```mojo
from core.base import CognitiveProcessor
from systems.consciousness import ConsciousnessFramework

# Initialize a basic cognitive processor
processor = CognitiveProcessor()

# Create a consciousness framework instance
framework = ConsciousnessFramework()

# Process cognitive tasks
result = processor.process(input_data)
```
