The linter errors indicate we need to properly set up the module system in Mojo. Since Mojo's module system is still evolving, let me explain the current state and next steps:
We have a solid foundation with:
Visitor pattern implementation for tag processing
Safety mechanisms through boundary and access management
Feedback system for learning and adaptation
Visualization capabilities for transparency
To make this work, we need to:
Create a proper package structure with __init__.mojo files
Ensure all imports are properly resolved
Set up proper type definitions and inheritance
Current limitations:
Mojo's module system is still in development
Some features like relative imports may not work as expected
We may need to adjust the architecture based on Mojo's capabilities
Next steps:
Organize the codebase into a proper package structure
Implement each component separately with clear interfaces
Create integration tests to verify the system works as expected
Would you like me to:
Create a proper package structure with all necessary files
Implement each component separately
Create integration tests
Or focus on a specific aspect of the system?
