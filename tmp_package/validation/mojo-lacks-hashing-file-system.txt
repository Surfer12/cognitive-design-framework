Alternative Approaches to File Validation in Mojo:
Key observations from our implementation attempts:
Current Mojo lacks robust file system and hashing libraries
Python integration is verbose and linter-challenging
Pure Mojo implementations require significant boilerplate
Recommended Next Steps:
Develop a Mojo-native file system library
Create a modular hashing utility
Build incremental file validation tools
