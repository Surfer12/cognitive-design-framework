The implementation reveals the current limitations of Mojo's Python interoperability. While the script demonstrates the potential, it requires significant workarounds.
Key observations:
Heavy reliance on Python modules
Extensive type conversions
Linter challenges with Python integration
Would you like me to:
Simplify the implementation
Create a pure Mojo version (with limited functionality)
Keep this Python-integrated version
Explore alternative approaches to file validation in Mojo
The choice depends on your specific requirements for the validation utility and how you intend to use it in the project.
