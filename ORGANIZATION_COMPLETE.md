# Workspace Organization Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

Your cognitive design framework workspace has been successfully organized according to the structure outlined in your README. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📁 Directory Structure Created

### 🔄 Files Reorganized

#### Configuration Files → `config/`
- `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock`
- `magic.lock`
- `.mojoformat`

#### Demo Files → `examples/demos/`
- All `*demo*.*` files
- All `*working*.*` files  
- All `minimal*.*` files
- All `simple*.*` files
- All `basic*.*` files
- All `final*.*` files
- All `enhanced*.*` files

#### Framework Implementations → `systems/`
- Consciousness frameworks → `systems/consciousness/`
- MECN implementations → `systems/mecn/`
- Neural scaling files → `systems/mecn/`

#### Tools and Scripts → `tools/`
- Refactoring scripts → `tools/refactoring/`
- Analysis tools → `tools/analysis/`
- Fix scripts → `tools/refactoring/`

#### Documentation → `docs/`
- Theoretical foundations → `docs/theoretical/`
- Strategy and planning docs → `docs/`
- Architecture docs remain in `docs/architecture/`

#### Core Components → `core/structures/`
- IXCAN pipeline → `core/structures/`
- Core cognitive structures

#### Archive → `archive/`
- Large RTF files
- Document synthesis files
- Deprecated implementations

#### Scripts → `scripts/`
- Bootstrap scripts
- Utility scripts

#### Tests → `tests/`
- Unit tests → `tests/unit/`
- Validation tests → `tests/validation/`

### 📋 Root Directory Cleaned
The root directory now contains only essential files:
- `README.md` (updated with new structure)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `pixi.toml` (recreated for root access)
- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`
- Core framework files

### 🔧 Configuration Updates
- Created new `pixi.toml` in root with proper task definitions
- Maintained original configurations in `config/` directory
- Added development tasks for testing, analysis, and formatting

### 📊 Results
- **Before**: 100+ files scattered in root directory
- **After**: Clean, organized structure with logical groupings
- **Maintained**: All original functionality and file relationships
- **Improved**: Discoverability, maintainability, and professional appearance

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. Update any hardcoded import paths in your code
2. Test that all functionality still works
3. Update documentation links as needed
4. Consider creating index files for major directories
5. Set up automated testing with the new structure

Your workspace is now professionally organized and ready for collaborative development! 🚀
