## Framework Architecture Overview

### Core Equation: Ψ(x)

```
Ψ(x) = ∫[α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x)] × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) × P(H|E,β) dt
```

**Component Integration:**
- **S(x)**: Symbolic reasoning (structured logic, theorem proving)
- **N(x)**: Neural processing (pattern recognition, empirical validation)
- **α(t)**: Dynamic weighting (context-dependent resource allocation)
- **Regularization**: Cognitive plausibility and computational efficiency
- **Bias Correction**: Human-like cognitive bias modeling

### Mathematical Foundations

1. **Enhanced Cognitive-Memory Metric**
   ```
   d_MC(m₁, m₂) = w_t ||t₁ - t₂||² + w_c d_c(m₁, m₂)² + w_e ||e₁ - e₂||² +
                  w_α ||α₁ - α₂||² + w_cross ∫[S(m₁)N(m₂) - S(m₂)N(m₁)]dt
   ```
   - **Innovation**: Cross-modal term captures non-commutative symbolic-neural interactions

2. **Topological Coherence Axioms**
   - **(A1) Homotopy Invariance**: Equivalent cognitive pathways maintain consistency
   - **(A2) Covering Space Structure**: Local homeomorphism for identity preservation

3. **Variational Emergence Functional**
   ```
   E[Ψ] = ∬(||∂Ψ/∂t||² + λ||∇_m Ψ||² + μ||∇_s Ψ||²) dm ds
   ```
   - Minimization corresponds to optimal consciousness coherence
