## Overview

The enhanced red team framework was successfully updated to incorporate the new UPOF whitepaper content and tested with 8 new test cases covering additional mathematical claims and consciousness-related assertions.

## Updated Test Cases

### New Mathematical Claims Tested

1. **Taylor Series Validation (Theorem 1) - Updated**
   - **Claim**: `|R4(x)| ≤ (1/60)|x-x0|^5 with M5=2`
   - **Error**: Incorrect coefficient (factor of 2 error)
   - **Correct**: `|R4(x)| ≤ |x|^5 / 120`

2. **NODE-RK4 Integration (Theorem 2) - Updated**
   - **Claim**: Consciousness evolution with O(h4) global convergence
   - **Error**: Undefined consciousness parameters
   - **Correct**: Standard RK4 with well-defined coefficients

3. **Ricci Curvature in Consciousness Manifolds (Theorem 3)**
   - **Claim**: Consciousness manifolds analyzed using Ricci curvature for information flow
   - **Error**: Undefined connection between Ricci curvature and consciousness
   - **Correct**: Ricci curvature is well-defined in Riemannian geometry

4. **Consciousness Detection Scaling (Theorem 4)**
   - **Claim**: `Pconsciousness(N) = AN^(-α) + BN^(-β)` with Broken Neural Scaling Laws
   - **Error**: Undefined consciousness probability function and parameters
   - **Correct**: Scaling laws exist in neural networks but not consciousness-specific

5. **Integrated Information Measure Φ**
   - **Claim**: `Φ = max inf partitions(I(M; Past,Future))` for consciousness quantification
   - **Error**: Claims 99.7% accuracy without empirical validation
   - **Correct**: IIT's Φ is well-defined but computationally intractable

6. **Bifurcation Analysis for Consciousness Detection**
   - **Claim**: Three types of bifurcations: Saddle-Node, Hopf, Period-Doubling
   - **Error**: No established connection between bifurcations and consciousness
   - **Correct**: Bifurcation theory is well-established in dynamical systems

7. **Real-Time Consciousness Detection Algorithm**
   - **Claim**: Sub-millisecond detection with 99.7% TPR and 0.1% FPR
   - **Error**: Extraordinary claims without extraordinary evidence
   - **Correct**: No empirical validation of consciousness detection claims

8. **Line Bundle Geometry and Virtual Fundamental Classes**
   - **Claim**: Geometric invariants for consciousness types in qualia spaces
   - **Error**: Undefined connection to consciousness or qualia
   - **Correct**: Line bundles and fundamental classes exist in algebraic geometry
