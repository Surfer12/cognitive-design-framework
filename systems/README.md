# Cognitive Systems

## Overview

The `systems/` directory contains specific system implementations that leverage the core cognitive processing infrastructure. These systems demonstrate practical applications of our cognitive design framework.

## Directory Structure

## System Types

### Autopoietic Systems
- **Characteristics**
  - Self-generating
  - Adaptive and responsive
  - Capable of complex state transformations

- **Key Components**
  - `system.mojo`: Core autopoietic system implementation
  - `test_system.mojo`: Comprehensive testing and demonstration

### Integration Systems
- **Purpose**
  - Enable communication between different cognitive modules
  - Provide flexible adaptation mechanisms
  - Support heterogeneous system interactions

- **Key Components**
  - `bridge.mojo`: Facilitates cross-system communication
  - `adapter.mojo`: Enables protocol and data structure translations

## Usage Example: Autopoietic System

```mojo
from systems.autopoietic.system import AutopoieticSystem, ConsciousVisitor

# Create an autopoietic system with 80% boundary permeability
var system = AutopoieticSystem(0.8)

# Add self-generation rules
system.add_rule("expand_boundaries")
system.add_rule("increase_complexity")

# Create a conscious visitor for observation
var visitor = ConsciousVisitor(depth=2.5)

# Let the system evolve and be observed
system.accept(visitor)
system.evolve()
```

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each system is designed to be independently configurable
2. **Adaptability**: Systems can modify their internal state and rules
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and reflection capabilities
4. **Performance**: Optimized for low-overhead processing

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal runtime overhead
- Supports concurrent processing
- Efficient state management
- Low memory footprint

## Future Roadmap

- Develop more complex autopoietic rule sets
- Create advanced integration mechanisms
- Implement machine learning adaptation strategies
- Expand system observation capabilities

## Contributing

1. Follow core framework guidelines
2. Maintain system independence
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Document system-specific behaviors
