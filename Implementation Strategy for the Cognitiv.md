Implementation Strategy for the Cognitive Chain of Thought (CCT) Model Using Mojo

Implementing the Cognitive Chain of Thought (CCT) Model exclusively in Mojo involves leveraging Mojo’s strengths in performance, parallelism, and system-level programming. This strategy outlines a phased approach, aligning with the project’s development stages, to ensure a structured and efficient implementation.

Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Functionality

1.1. Environment Setup
	•	Install Mojo Compiler and Tools:
	•	Ensure the latest version of Mojo is installed.
	•	Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or editor with Mojo support (e.g., VS Code with Mojo extensions).
	•	Initialize the Project:
	•	Create a project directory, e.g., CCTModel.
	•	Initialize version control using Git.

1.2. Define Core Data Structures

Utilize Mojo’s structs and enums to model the cognitive processes and YAML-like structures.

# File: cct_model.mojo

module CCTModelModule:

    from collections import Map

    # Enum for Cognitive Process Tags
    enum CognitiveTag:
        understanding
        analysis
        exploration
        reflection
        meta_observation

    # Custom Data Types for Cognitive Elements
    enum CognitionType:
        thought
        emotion
        intuition

    # Struct for Multilingual Thought Representation
    struct MultilingualThought:
        en: str
        es: str
        fr: str

    # Struct for Complex Data Structures
    struct CognitiveFrameworks:
        thought_patterns: Set[str]
        emotional_states: OrderedMap[str, str]

    # Struct for Repetitive Cognitive Patterns
    struct CognitivePattern:
        thought_cycle: List[str]
        emotional_cycle: List[str]

    # Struct for External Insights
    struct ExternalInsight:
        link: str
        description: str
        quote: str

1.3. Implement the YAML-like Recursive Structure

Simulate YAML’s recursive capabilities using Mojo’s pointers and references.

    # Struct for Recursive Thought Nodes
    struct ThoughtNode:
        id: Int
        description: str
        subThoughts: List[Pointer[ThoughtNode]]
        aliasReference: Pointer[ThoughtNode] = none
        cachedInsight: str = ""

    # Struct for the CCT Model
    struct CCTModel:
        nodes: Map[Int, Pointer[ThoughtNode]]
        memoCache: Map[Int, str]

        # Function to Add Nodes
        fn add_node(self: inout CCTModel, node: Pointer[ThoughtNode]) -> Void:
            self.nodes[node.id] = node

        # Function to Evaluate a Thought Node with Memoization
        fn evaluate_thought_node(self: inout CCTModel, node: Pointer[ThoughtNode]) -> str:
            if self.memoCache.contains_key(node.id):
                return self.memoCache[node.id]

            base_insight = "Evaluating ThoughtNode ID: " + node.id.to_string() + " - " + node.description
            sub_insights = ""
            for sub in node.subThoughts:
                sub_insights += "\n- Sub Insight: " + self.evaluate_thought_node(sub)

            alias_insight = ""
            if node.aliasReference != none:
                alias_insight = "\n- Alias Insight: " + self.evaluate_thought_node(node.aliasReference)

            final_insight = base_insight + sub_insights + alias_insight
            self.memoCache[node.id] = final_insight
            node.cachedInsight = final_insight
            return final_insight

        # Function to Process All Nodes
        fn process_all_nodes(self: inout CCTModel) -> List[str]:
            insights = []
            for (id, node) in self.nodes:
                insights.append(self.evaluate_thought_node(node))
            return insights

1.4. Develop the Basic Reasoning Engine

Create functions to traverse and interpret the recursive structure, simulating human-like reasoning.

    # Main Function to Demonstrate Core Functionality

            nodes=Map[Int, Pointer[ThoughtNode]](),
            memoCache=Map[Int, str]()
        )

        # Create ThoughtNodes
        let node1 = @ThoughtNode(
            id=1,
            description="Embrace the unknown",
            subThoughts=[]
        )

        let node2 = @ThoughtNode(
            id=2,
            description="Analyze the complexity",
            subThoughts=[]
        )

        let node3 = @ThoughtNode(
            id=3,
            description="Reflect on recursion",
            subThoughts=[node2]
        )

        let node4 = @ThoughtNode(
            id=4,
            description="Meta-observation node",
            subThoughts=[],
            aliasReference=node1
        )

        # Add Nodes to the Model
        model.add_node(node1)
        model.add_node(node2)
        model.add_node(node3)
        model.add_node(node4)

        # Evaluate All Nodes
        let insights = model.process_all_nodes()

            if self.memoCache.contains_key(node.id):
                return self.memoCache[node.id]

            base_insight = "Evaluating ThoughtNode ID: " + node.id.to_string() + " - " + node.description
            sub_insights = ""
            concurrent_tasks = []
            for sub in node.subThoughts:
                # Spawn concurrent evaluations
                let task = spawn self.evaluate_thought_node(sub)
                concurrent_tasks.append(task)

            # Await all concurrent tasks
            for task in concurrent_tasks:
                sub_insights += "\n- Sub Insight: " + task.await()

            alias_insight = ""
            if node.aliasReference != none:
                alias_insight = "\n- Alias Insight: " + self.evaluate_thought_node_concurrent(node.aliasReference)

            final_insight = base_insight + sub_insights + alias_insight
            self.memoCache[node.id] = final_insight
