# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core cognitive structures for the Meta-Optimized Hybrid Reasoning Framework, establishing the foundational components for cognitive processing, visitor pattern support, autopoietic systems integration, and boundary transformation logic. The implementation will create a robust, modular architecture that supports emergent learning ecosystems with metacognitive capabilities, following the theoretical foundations outlined in the project documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Cognitive Processing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a cognitive system developer, I want a robust core processing infrastructure, so that I can build sophisticated cognitive applications with reliable foundational components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a CognitiveBridge with proper context management
2. WHEN processing cognitive elements THEN the system SHALL maintain thread-safe state management
3. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL capture and report them through the context system
4. IF the system encounters invalid cognitive elements THEN it SHALL validate them before processing
5. WHEN the system processes multiple elements THEN it SHALL maintain processing order and dependencies

### Requirement 2: Visitor Pattern Support with Cognitive Extensions

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want comprehensive visitor pattern support with cognitive-specific extensions, so that I can implement flexible processing pipelines for different cognitive element types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor is created THEN it SHALL implement the base Visitor interface with cognitive-specific methods
2. WHEN visiting TagElements THEN the visitor SHALL process both the element and its children recursively
3. WHEN visiting CognitiveBridge components THEN the visitor SHALL access processing context and state
4. WHEN visiting AutopoieticSystem components THEN the visitor SHALL handle system state transitions
5. IF a visitor encounters processing errors THEN it SHALL report them through the validation system
6. WHEN multiple visitors are chained THEN they SHALL execute in the specified order with proper state passing

### Requirement 3: Autopoietic System Integration

**User Story:** As a cognitive researcher, I want integrated autopoietic systems that can self-maintain and adapt, so that I can create systems with emergent learning capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AutopoieticSystem is created THEN it SHALL initialize with proper self-maintenance capabilities
2. WHEN the system processes inputs THEN it SHALL update its internal state based on autopoietic principles
3. WHEN system boundaries are crossed THEN it SHALL maintain system integrity and identity
4. IF the system detects structural changes THEN it SHALL adapt its processing patterns accordingly
5. WHEN the system reaches stability THEN it SHALL maintain homeostatic balance while remaining adaptive
6. WHEN integrating with other systems THEN it SHALL preserve its autopoietic properties

### Requirement 4: Boundary Transformation Logic

**User Story:** As a system designer, I want sophisticated boundary transformation capabilities, so that I can implement systems that can dynamically reconfigure their processing boundaries based on context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN boundary conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL analyze transformation requirements
2. WHEN transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity across boundary changes
3. WHEN multiple boundaries interact THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using defined precedence rules
4. IF transformation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous stable boundary state
5. WHEN boundaries are transformed THEN the system SHALL notify affected components of the changes
6. WHEN recursive transformations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite loops and maintain stability

### Requirement 5: Metacognitive Monitoring and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a cognitive system user, I want the system to monitor and adapt its own processing, so that it can optimize performance and learn from experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes elements THEN it SHALL monitor its own cognitive load and performance
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and adapt processing strategies
3. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL recognize and incorporate them into future processing
4. IF the system detects inefficiencies THEN it SHALL adjust its processing parameters automatically
5. WHEN the system learns new patterns THEN it SHALL integrate them without disrupting existing functionality
6. WHEN reflection is triggered THEN the system SHALL analyze its own processing history and outcomes

### Requirement 6: Integration and Extensibility Framework

**User Story:** As a framework user, I want a clean integration and extensibility framework, so that I can easily add new cognitive components and integrate with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new cognitive components are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing visitor patterns
2. WHEN external systems connect THEN the framework SHALL provide standardized interfaces for integration
3. WHEN the system is extended THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing components
4. IF integration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution guidance
5. WHEN components are removed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle dependencies and cleanup resources
6. WHEN the framework is configured THEN it SHALL validate configuration parameters and provide helpful feedback
