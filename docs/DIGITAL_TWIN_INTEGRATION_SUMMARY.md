- **Real-time learning** with adaptive rates (0.05-0.5)
- **25 total predictions** across 3 patients over 7 days
- **Autopoietic health scores** averaging 0.87/1.0

### Patient-Specific Adaptations
1. **Elderly Patient with Renal Impairment**
   - Higher uncertainty due to variable physiology
   - Adaptive learning rate: 0.326 (high adaptation)
   - Intensive monitoring recommended

2. **Young Athletic Patient**
   - More predictable responses
   - Adaptive learning rate: 0.142 (stable)
   - Standard monitoring sufficient

3. **Non-adherent Patient**
   - Highest variability in outcomes
   - Adaptive learning rate: 0.329 (high adaptation)
   - Adherence tracking critical

## Revolutionary Advantages

### 1. Beyond Traditional Approaches
| Traditional PK Models | Ensemble Neural Networks | Our Digital Twin |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|

| No causal reasoning | Correlation-based | Counterfactual inference |
| Manual dose adjustment | Prediction only | Automated policy optimization |

### 2. Cognitive-Theoretic Foundation
Unlike purely empirical AI approaches, our system provides:
- **Philosophical coherence** through cognitive design principles
- **Ethical boundaries** via autopoietic self-regulation
- **Meta-epistemological validation** of learning processes
- **Jungian archetypal structures** for holistic patient modeling

### 3. Clinical Impact
