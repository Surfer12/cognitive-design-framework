Key changes I've made:
In tag_element.mojo:
Removed relative import
Added raises to methods that interact with Python
Used Python.type() instead of isinstance()
Renamed metadata to _metadata
Added a method to get the full metadata dictionary
Changed visitor parameter to PythonObject
In visitor.mojo:
Removed relative import
Added raises to methods that interact with Python
Used Python.type() instead of isinstance()
Renamed errors and state to _errors and _state
Added methods to get full errors list and state dictionary
Changed element parameter to PythonObject
These changes address the linter errors and follow the Python integration guidelines from the documentation:
Using Python.import_module() for importing Python modules
Using PythonObject for Python-specific types
Adding raises to methods that may raise exceptions
Using Python.type() for type checking
