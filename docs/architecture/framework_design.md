## Design Principles

1. **Adaptive Intelligence:** Systems that learn and evolve
2. **Performance Optimization:** Intelligent computational strategy selection
3. **Safety-First Approach:** Proactive risk management
4. **Seamless Interoperability:** Cross-language and cross-paradigm support

## Example Usage

```mojo
fn main():
    var cognitive_framework = IntelligentCognitiveFramework()
    
    # Process complex data with adaptive intelligence
    var processed_data = cognitive_framework.process_cognitive_task(
        input_data, 
        complexity_score
    )
    
    # Analyze framework performance
    var performance_metrics = cognitive_framework.analyze_framework_performance()
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Computational Overhead:** Minimal runtime penalties
- **Scalability:** Adapts to varying computational complexities
- **Flexibility:** Supports diverse input types and processing requirements
