Research Hypotheses

Cognitive Transformation Hypothesis

CopyEach systemic visitation recursively redefines observational potential,
creating meta-level understanding through controlled interactions
with adaptive cognitive architectures.

Boundary Negotiation Hypothesis

CopySystem boundaries are dynamic, emergent constructs
that evolve through strategic interactions, where transformation
potential determines engagement and semantic generation strategies.
