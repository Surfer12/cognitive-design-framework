struct FilePath:
    pass

    Safe file path representation with explicit absolute/relative handling.
    var _path: String = ""
    var _is_absolute: Bool

    fn __init__(inout self):
    pass

    Create a FilePath, automatically detecting absolute/relative paths.

    Args:

    path: File system path
    var is_absolute = path.startswith("/") or path.contains(":")
    return Self {
    _path: os_path.abspath(path),
    _is_absolute: is_absolute
    }

    fn absolute(inout self) -> String:

    """Return the absolute path."""
    return self._path

    fn join(inout self) -> String:

    Safely join path components.

    Args:

    components: Path segments to join

    Returns:

    Fully resolved path
    var full_path = self._path
    for component in components:

    full_path = os_path.join(full_path, component)
    return full_path

    fn exists(inout self) -> Bool:

    """Check if path exists."""
    return os_path.exists(self._path)

    fn is_file(inout self) -> Bool:

    """Check if path is a file."""
    return os_path.isfile(self._path)

    fn is_directory(inout self) -> Bool:

    """Check if path is a directory."""
    return os_path.isdir(self._path)

struct FileTraversal:
    pass

    Provides safe, explicit directory traversal capabilities.

    fn walk(base_path: FilePath) -> List[FilePath]:

    Recursively walk a directory and return all file paths.

    Args:

    base_path: Starting directory path

    Returns:

    List of discovered file paths
    var discovered_files = List[FilePath]()

    # Use Python's os.walk for initial implementation
    for root, _, files in os.walk(base_path.absolute()):

    for file in files:

    discovered_files.append(
    FilePath(os_path.join(root, file))
    )

    return discovered_files

struct FileOperations:
    pass

    Comprehensive file reading and writing utilities.

    fn read_binary(inout self) -> Bytes:

    Read entire file data.

    Args:

    path: File path to read

    Returns:

    Raw byte content
    # Placeholder for native implementation

    fn write_binary():
    pass

    Write binary content to file.

    Args:

    path: Destination file path
    content: Byte content to write
    # Placeholder for native implementation
