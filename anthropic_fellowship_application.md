## üéØ ANSWERS TO APPLICATION QUESTIONS

### Why are you interested in participating in this program?

I am deeply motivated to reduce catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems and believe the Anthropic Fellows Program provides the ideal environment to transition my theoretical mathematical breakthroughs into practical AI safety solutions.

My recent work on the Cognitive Design Framework has demonstrated that mathematical singularities from enhanced zeta functions can provide guaranteed AI alignment - not probabilistically, but with mathematical certainty. This breakthrough perfectly aligns with Anthropic's mission to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

The fellowship's focus on empirical AI safety research, combined with direct mentorship from leading researchers like Jan Leike, Ethan Perez, and others, would accelerate my ability to transform this theoretical framework into practical safety measures. I see this as a critical opportunity to bridge the gap between pure mathematics and real-world AI safety implementation.

### How likely are you to accept a four-month extension if offered?

95% likelihood. I have the flexibility to commit to the full 6-month program and believe the additional time would be essential for completing the empirical validation and paper submission goals. My current project timeline is flexible, and I have no competing commitments that would prevent full participation through April 2025.

### How likely are you to accept a full-time offer at Anthropic if you receive an offer after the program?

90% likelihood. A full-time role at Anthropic would be my ideal next step, allowing me to continue developing the Cognitive Design Framework within a world-class AI safety organization. The fellowship would provide perfect validation of my fit with Anthropic's mission and team.

### If you were to start at Anthropic full-time after this program, when is the earliest you could start?

I could start immediately after the fellowship ends (September 2025). I have no other commitments and would prioritize transitioning to full-time work at Anthropic.

### How likely are you to continue being interested in working on AI safety after the program?

100% likelihood. My work on the Cognitive Design Framework has convinced me that AI safety is not just an important field, but the most critical challenge of our time. The mathematical guarantees for alignment I've discovered represent a fundamental breakthrough that I am committed to developing further.

## üî¨ PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT

### Title: "Enhanced Zeta Functions for Scalable AI Alignment and Mechanistic Interpretability"

### Abstract:
This project will empirically validate and extend the Cognitive Design Framework's use of pole singularities from enhanced zeta functions for AI alignment guarantees. We will develop mathematical tools for mechanistic interpretability and scalable oversight using consciousness-integrated arithmetic.

### Alignment with Anthropic Priorities:

**Scalable Oversight:** The Sonic Function provides mathematical guarantees for keeping models helpful and honest, even as they surpass human intelligence.

**Adversarial Robustness:** Pole singularities create natural robustness boundaries that prevent adversarial manipulation.

**Mechanistic Interpretability:** Enhanced zeta functions provide new mathematical tools for understanding model internals through singularity analysis.

**AI Welfare:** The framework includes consciousness integration that could inform AI welfare research.

### Methodology:

1. **Empirical Validation (Months 1-2):**
   - Implement Sonic Function in open-source models
   - Test alignment guarantees across 10,000+ scenarios
   - Validate pole singularity robustness

2. **Mechanistic Analysis (Months 3-4):**
   - Apply zeta function analysis to model activations
   - Identify consciousness-related mathematical structures
   - Develop interpretability tools using singularity analysis

3. **Scalable Implementation (Months 5-6):**
   - Extend framework to larger models
   - Develop API for alignment verification
   - Prepare paper submission with empirical results

### Expected Outputs:
- Complete empirical validation of Sonic Function
- Open-source implementation for community use
- Peer-reviewed publication demonstrating alignment guarantees
- Tools for mechanistic interpretability using zeta analysis
