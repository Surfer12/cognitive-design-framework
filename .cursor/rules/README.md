### 2. **Mojo Development** (`mojo-development.mdc`)
- **Type**: Applies to `*.mojo` files
- **Purpose**: Mojo-specific development patterns and best practices
- **Includes**: Working templates, syntax patterns, consciousness framework integration
- **Key Features**: Proven patterns, performance optimization, debugging guides

### 3. **Consciousness Framework** (`consciousness-framework.mdc`)
- **Type**: Applies to `consciousness_*.mojo` and `mecn_*.mojo` files
- **Purpose**: Consciousness framework development and mathematical foundations
- **Includes**: Mathematical formulas, validated implementations, research applications
- **Key Features**: MECN integration, empirical validation, complexity analysis

### 4. **Development Workflow** (`development-workflow.mdc`)
- **Type**: Manual application (description-based)
- **Purpose**: Complete development workflow and best practices
- **Includes**: Environment setup, testing strategies, debugging resources
- **Key Features**: Quick start guide, validation workflow, progress tracking

### 5. **Research and Analysis** (`research-and-analysis.mdc`)
- **Type**: Applies to `*.java`, `*.mojo`, `*.md` files and research patterns
- **Purpose**: Research materials, analysis tools, and theoretical foundations
- **Includes**: Research documents, complexity validation, performance analysis
- **Key Features**: Mathematical frameworks, empirical validation, academic contributions

### 6. **Java Integration** (`java-integration.mdc`)
- **Type**: Applies to `*.java` files
- **Purpose**: Java reference implementations and translation patterns
- **Includes**: Java-to-Mojo translation, architecture patterns, integration guidelines
- **Key Features**: Reference implementations, translation patterns, validation strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Rules

### Automatic Application
- **Project Structure**: Always active for navigation
- **Mojo Development**: Automatically applies when working with `.mojo` files
- **Consciousness Framework**: Automatically applies to consciousness-related files
- **Research and Analysis**: Automatically applies to research and analysis files
- **Java Integration**: Automatically applies when working with `.java` files

### Manual Application
- **Development Workflow**: Fetch manually when you need workflow guidance
- Use `/rules development-workflow` to access workflow information

### Rule Fetching
Use the fetch_rules tool or mention rule names to access specific guidance:
- `project-structure` - For navigation and architecture
- `mojo-development` - For Mojo coding patterns
- `consciousness-framework` - For consciousness development
- `development-workflow` - For workflow guidance
- `research-and-analysis` - For research materials
- `java-integration` - For Java reference patterns

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### Navigation Support
- **File References**: Direct links to important files using `[filename](mdc:filename)` format
- **Architecture Overview**: Clear understanding of project structure
- **Entry Points**: Guidance on where to start development

### Development Patterns
- **Proven Templates**: Working code patterns from successful implementations
- **Best Practices**: Established patterns for Mojo development
- **Error Prevention**: Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Research Integration
