# Phase-Space Trajectory Analysis for Ryan David Oates' Dynamical Systems

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive analysis of the phase-space trajectory visualization and core equation dynamics as described in Ryan David Oates' work on dynamical systems. The implementation directly corresponds to the detailed explanation provided, which analyzed a 3D phase-space plot showing the evolution of parameters α(t), λ₁(t), and λ₂(t) over time.

## Core Equation

The implementation centers around the core equation:

```
Ψ(x) = ∫[α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x) + w_cross[S(m₁)N(m₂) - S(m₂)N(m₁)]] × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) × P(H|E,β) dt
```

Where:
- **α(t)**: Dynamic weighting factor balancing symbolic and neural outputs
- **S(x)**: Symbolic reasoning output (RK4-derived physics solutions)
- **N(x)**: Neural processing output (LSTM predictions)
- **w_cross**: Cross-coupling weight for multi-mode interactions
- **λ₁, λ₂**: Regularization weights for cognitive plausibility and efficiency
- **R_cognitive, R_efficiency**: Penalty terms
- **P(H|E,β)**: Bias-adjusted probability with expert knowledge

alpha_trajectory[0] = 0.0    # Start at origin
lambda1_trajectory[0] = 2.0  # High cognitive penalty initially
lambda2_trajectory[0] = 0.0  # Low efficiency penalty initially

# Dynamic evolution using Neural ODE formulation
alpha_trajectory[i] = 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(2 * (t - 1.0)))  # Smooth 0→2 transition
lambda1_trajectory[i] = 2.0 - 0.5 * t * (1 + 0.2 * np.sin(3 * t))  # 2→1 decay
lambda2_trajectory[i] = t * (1 + 0.1 * np.cos(4 * t))  # 0→2 growth
```
